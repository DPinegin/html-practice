   <h1>HTML Forms</h1>
   <!--The form tag is used to create a container where all the inputs from a form must be put inside.
    Th eattributes that are required are name, id, and method.
    Name gives descriptive information about what the form will be used for.
    id allows us to refrence this form later in fieldsests and other areas of our code.
    method has two typical values; get and post. Get is used for forms that do not ask
    for personal information, (search bars, etc.). Post is used for forms that do ask
    for personal information (login and signup pages, etc. )-->
   <form name="travel-suggestions" id="travel" method="get">
    <!--This is a text input. type= "text", name, and id are all required attributes.
    Th erequired attributes are only necessary when you want to make sure the user
    has to fill teh input before submitting the form.
    All inputs need a label with the for attribute that links the label to the
    input using the input's id attribute.
    When an input is required, it i simportant to include the word required in the label's text.-->
        <label for="travel-location">please enter the city or country you suggest I travel to [required]:</label>
        <input type="text" name="destination" id="travel-location" required />
