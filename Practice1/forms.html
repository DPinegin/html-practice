      <!--The form tag is used to create a container where all the inputs from a form must be put inside.
        The attributes that are required are name, id, and method.
        Name gives descriptive information about what the form will be used for.
        id allows us to refrence this form later in fieldsests and other areas of our code.
        method has two typical values; get and post. Get is used for forms that do not ask
        for personal information, (search bars, etc.). Post is used for forms that do ask
        for personal information (login and signup pages, etc. )-->

        The type attribute defines the type of input.
        The name attribute defines the variable name that would be used for
        the input when data gets passed to the server (requires back-end scrpting,which is beyond teh scope of this course)
