    <!--Paragraphs are an example of block elements, because by deafault, they
    take up the entire width of the webpage and add space at the top and bottom of the element. -->
    <p>This web-page shows the difference between block and inline elements.</p>

    <!--Anchors are an example of inline elements, becuase by deafault, 
    they only take up the space that they need to.

    We showed the differnec bewteen blck and inline elemnts by using the developer
     tools, which we accessed by using the ctr. + shift. + i. Developer tools are 
     helpful to show you the  exact code that is used to display a specific 
     element and can show you the width, height and spacing around an element. -->

    <!--This is an example of an image tag. The src attributes is the location of the image 
    we want to display. The src attribute can be an interebet location 
    (i.e., hrrps://www.google.com/...) but the best practice is to have your own images folder 
    that stores all the images you use on your website. NOTE: img is a self-closing tag. )-->
