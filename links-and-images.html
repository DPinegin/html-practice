    <!--This is an example of an image tag. The src attributes is the location of the image 
    we want to display. The src attribute can be an interebet location 
    (i.e., hrrps://www.google.com/...) but the best practice is to have your own images folder 
    that stores all the images you use on your website. NOTE: img is a self-closing tag. )-->
